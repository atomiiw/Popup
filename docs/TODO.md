# TODO — Implementation Steps (2026 H1: Development)

**Closed.** Current work: [TODO-2026H2.md](TODO-2026H2.md) (maintenance & updates).

Work through these steps **in order**. Do not skip ahead or add features from later steps.

## Step 1: Highlight Detection & Popup UI (ChatGPT only) — DONE
- `content.js` detects text selection in AI responses, shows floating popup
- `styles.css` with CSS variables, dark mode, all popup components
- Send button is a **stub** (logs to console only)
- Dismissal on click outside, Escape, SPA navigation

## Step 1b: Sentence Context Extraction — DONE
- `extractSentence(range)` finds the containing sentence(s) for any selection, expanding to full sentence boundaries
- Block-level ancestor detection (`findBlockAncestor`) bounds sentence search to the paragraph/list item/heading
- Code blocks (`<pre>`) return entire block content (periods aren't sentence boundaries)
- Popup shows full sentence context in blockquote with exact selection highlighted inline (colored background mark)
- Injected message includes both sentence context and exact quote

## Step 2: Chat Injection (ChatGPT only) — DONE
- Wire the send button to inject the follow-up question into ChatGPT's actual chat input
- Quote the highlighted text as context in the message
- Find and click ChatGPT's send button programmatically
- Handle edge cases: input not found, send button not found

## Step 2b: Response Length Toggle — DONE
- Send arrow icon: clicking sends with the last-used mode (defaults to Normal)
- A "switch" button appears below the send icon showing the other mode (e.g. "Brief" if current is Normal)
- Clicking the switch button switches mode and sends immediately
- **Brief** appends a one-time instruction for 2-3 sentences; **Normal** tells ChatGPT to ignore prior brevity instructions
- Last-used mode persists across popups within the session via `st.responseMode`
- Same interface used for both initial question input and edited question re-send

## Step 3: Response Capture & Hide Q&A — DONE
- Popup stays open after send, transitions to loading state ("Waiting for response…")
- Polls for new conversation turns; hides injected question turn and AI response turn from main chat
- When AI response finishes streaming, extracts content and displays it inside the popup (scrollable, max 300px)
- Saves highlight + Q&A turn numbers to `chrome.storage.local` via `saveHighlight()` + `linkQA()`
- Dismissal during loading cancels the watch and unhides any hidden turns
- Timeout after 60 seconds shows "Response timed out." and unhides turns
- Brief mode instruction updated to be explicitly one-time ("For this response only…")

## Step 3b: Source Text Shadow Highlight & Popup Anchoring — DONE
- When a popup opens, the selected source text in the AI response is wrapped in `<span class="jr-source-highlight">` for a persistent visual highlight
- Popup is appended inside the chat scroll container (not `document.body`), so it scrolls naturally with the content — no scroll/resize listeners needed
- Popup is positioned to the right of the highlight (falls back to left if insufficient space)
- On popup dismiss, highlight spans are unwrapped and the DOM is restored cleanly
- Response detection uses send button absence (`isGenerating()`) instead of `.result-streaming` class + MutationObserver content stability
- Scroll position preserved during injection — `lockScroll()` patches both scroll events and `scrollTo()` to prevent ChatGPT's auto-scroll

## Step 3c: Persistent Highlights & Re-open Popup on Click — DONE
- After a response is captured, source highlight spans stay visible with `jr-source-highlight-done` class (pointer cursor)
- Closing the popup preserves the highlight instead of unwrapping the spans
- Clicking a completed highlight re-opens a read-only popup showing the context blockquote and response (no input row)
- In-progress or pre-send popups still clean up fully on dismiss (no regression)
- SPA navigation unwraps all completed highlight spans and clears the in-memory Map
- In-memory only — no persistence across page reload (that's Step 4)

## Step 3d: Copyable Highlight Text — DONE
- Problem: when the user selects text, the popup immediately captures focus for typing, so Ctrl+C copies nothing
- Clicking on source highlight spans while a popup is open does not dismiss the popup
- `selectSourceHighlightText()` programmatically selects all highlight text on click — runs on the `click` event (not just `mouseup`) because the browser's default click behavior collapses selections between mouseup and click
- Works in all popup states: typing a question, waiting for response, and viewing the completed response
- The `mouseup` handler skips new popup creation when interacting with active source highlights; also skips for completed highlights to prevent a race with the click handler
- Clicking back into the popup input re-enters edit mode (restores focus for typing a follow-up)
- CSS `user-select: text` on `.jr-source-highlight` ensures text is selectable even if the host site disables it

## Step 4: Persistence Across Reload — DONE
- Storage schema expanded: each highlight now stores `sentence`, `blockTypes`, `responseHTML`, `sourceTurnIndex` alongside existing fields
- `saveHighlight()` accepts all fields in a single call (id, text, sentence, blockTypes, responseHTML, url, site, sourceTurnIndex, questionIndex, responseIndex)
- `restoreHighlights()` on page load queries storage for the current URL, polls DOM for turns to appear, re-wraps source text via `findTextRange()` + `highlightRange()`, hides Q&A turns, populates `completedHighlights` Map
- Clicking a restored highlight re-opens the read-only popup with the saved response (reuses `openCompletedPopup()`)
- SPA navigation: `onNavigate()` cleans up old highlights, then calls `restoreHighlights()` after a delay for React to render the new conversation
- `findTextRange(root, searchText)` walks text nodes in an element, concatenates content, finds the substring, and maps back to a DOM Range

## Step 4b: Chained Popups — DONE
- Highlighting text inside a popup's response area spawns a new child popup **next to the parent** (both visible simultaneously)
- Selected text in the parent popup's response is wrapped in `jr-source-highlight` spans via `highlightRange()` — same as main chat
- Chained popup has its own context blockquote, input field, and send button
- Chained popups inject into the same chat thread, maintaining full AI context
- After response capture, source highlight spans become `jr-source-highlight-done` — clickable to reopen the chained popup
- Parent-child relationships stored via `parentId` in both `completedHighlights` Map and `chrome.storage.local`
- `popupStack` saves parent popup state when a child opens; Escape peels one layer, click outside closes all
- `pushPopupState()` / `removeAllPopups()` manage the stack lifecycle
- Parent's `responseHTML` is updated to include chained highlight spans for persistence
- On reopen, `openCompletedPopup()` restores chained highlight entries from DOM spans and loads children from storage
- Infinite chaining depth supported — each chained response can be highlighted for deeper follow-ups
- `user-select: text` on `.jr-popup-response` ensures text is selectable in all host sites

## Step 5: Popup Window Formatting — DONE

### Step 5a: Resizable Popup — DONE
- Allow the user to drag the popup's edges to make it wider (or narrower)
- Show a resize cursor (`col-resize` / `ew-resize`) when hovering near the left or right edge of the popup
- On mousedown at the edge, track mousemove to adjust the popup width in real time
- Respect a minimum width (e.g. 280px) and maximum width (e.g. viewport width minus padding)
- The resized width persists for subsequent popups within the same page session (module-level variable)
- Works for both regular popups and chained popups

### Step 5b: Preserve Response Markdown Formatting — DONE
- The AI response displayed inside `.jr-popup-response` must faithfully reproduce ChatGPT's rendered markdown formatting
- Horizontal rules (`<hr>`) should render as visible separator lines, not collapse to zero height
- Paragraph spacing / section gaps between headings, paragraphs, and lists must match the original — no content jamming together
- Code blocks, blockquotes, tables, and other markdown elements should retain their visual structure
- Add targeted CSS rules inside `.jr-popup-response` to restore spacing and separators that the popup's scoped styles may strip

### Step 5c: Popup Anchor Arrow — DONE
- Add a small arrow (CSS triangle or caret) on the popup border that points toward the source highlight the popup belongs to
- Arrow sits on the edge of the popup closest to the highlight (top edge if popup is below, bottom edge if above)
- Arrow position tracks the horizontal center of the highlight
- Works for level-1 popups, completed popups, and chained popups

### Step 5d: Show Question in Popup — DONE
- After a response is captured, display the follow-up question the user asked inside the popup, directly below the selected-text blockquote and above the AI response
- The question should be visually distinct from the context and response (e.g. different styling or label)
- Persisted in storage so it appears on popup reopen and after page reload
- Works for both regular and chained popups

### Step 5e: Edit Question & Response Versions — DONE
- Allow the user to edit the follow-up question after a response is captured
- A pencil icon and send icon appear next to the question text in completed popups
- Clicking the pencil toggles edit mode: question text becomes editable in place (contenteditable), pencil appears "pressed"/darkened, send icon becomes visible
- Clicking the pencil again exits edit mode and discards changes (restores original)
- Send icon is greyed out until the text changes; clicking it (or pressing Enter) submits the edited question
- Escape cancels edit mode
- On send: the new question is injected into the chat, the old response is replaced by a loading/streaming view, and the new AI response is captured
- Both old and new responses are kept as **versions** — the popup shows a version nav bar (`◀ 1 / 2 ▶`) when multiple versions exist
- Clicking version nav arrows switches the displayed question text and response HTML
- Storage: each highlight gains optional `versions` array and `activeVersion` index; backward compatible (lazily initialized from top-level fields when absent)
- `addHighlightVersion(id, versionObj)` pushes a new version and syncs top-level fields
- `setHighlightActiveVersion(id, index)` switches the active version and syncs top-level fields
- On page reload, all versions' Q&A turns are hidden (not just the active version's)
- Dismissing the popup during an edit response detaches (keeps polling in background), same as new popups
- Works for both level-1 and chained popups

## Step 6: Streaming Response in Popup — DONE
- Instead of showing a blank/white popup while waiting for the AI response, stream the response word-by-word into the popup in real time — matching how ChatGPT streams its own responses
- While polling for the AI response, continuously read the response turn's current HTML and update `.jr-popup-response` with whatever content has been generated so far
- The popup should show partial content as it arrives, so users can read along during generation instead of staring at a "Waiting for response…" message
- Once streaming is complete (generation finished), finalize the response content as before (save to storage, mark highlight as done, etc.)
- Works for both level-1 popups and chained popups

## Step 7: General Formatting

### Step 7e: Match ChatGPT Font Size in Popup Response — DONE
- The `.jr-popup-response` font size must match ChatGPT's response text (16px), not a reduced size
- Ensures the popup feels like a natural continuation of the chat, not a miniaturized sidebar

### Step 7f: Preserve Selection on Popup Open — DONE
- When a popup opens from a text selection, keep the browser's native selection active (do not clear it or auto-focus the input)
- This lets the user immediately Cmd+C / Ctrl+C to copy the selected text — the native selection overlays the JR source highlight (two visual layers)
- The input field does NOT auto-focus on popup open; the user must click the input to start typing
- Clicking the input field clears the native selection and focuses the input for typing
- Works for both level-1 popups and chained popups

### Step 7a: Highlight Toolbar (Color Picker + Delete) — DONE
- A floating pill-shaped toolbar appears near the highlighted text, on the opposite side from the popup
- 5 color swatches (blue, yellow, green, pink, purple) + trash icon
- Clicking a swatch updates the highlight and popup blockquote color, persists in `chrome.storage.local`
- Clicking trash shows confirmation inside popup: "Delete this highlight and N follow-up(s)?"
  - Confirm: removes highlight spans, keeps Q&A turns hidden, cascade-deletes from storage, closes popup
  - Cancel: returns to the normal popup view
- Deleted turns stay hidden across page reload via `jumpreturn_deleted_turns` storage (per-URL)
- Highlight color persists across page reload via storage
- Cascade: deleting a parent highlight also deletes all its chained children
- The toolbar only appears on completed highlights (not on new/in-progress popups)

### Step 7b: Highlight Hover & Active States — DONE
- Darken the highlight background color when the mouse hovers over a completed highlight span
- Apply a distinct "active/selected" background color when a highlight's popup is currently open
- Hover uses `:hover` pseudo-class; active uses `.jr-source-highlight-active` class toggled by `JR.syncHighlightActive()` (1.2.1: shades and the class removed; the function only draws the open-popup underline)
- Works for all 5 highlight colors + default blue, in both light and dark mode
- Works for both level-1 highlights in the chat and chained highlights inside popup responses

### Step 7d: Highlight Navigation Arrows — DONE
- Provide navigation arrows (or a small floating control) to jump between highlights on the page
- Level-1 navigation: arrows cycle through all level-1 highlights in the conversation, scrolling the chat to bring each one into view
- Level-2 navigation: when a level-1 popup is open, arrows cycle through all chained highlights within that popup's response, scrolling the response area as needed
- Current position indicator (e.g. "2 / 5") shows which highlight is focused
- Clicking an arrow scrolls to the highlight and opens its popup

## Step 8: Debugging & Polish

### Step 8a: Remove Multi-Site Scaffolding — DONE
- Strip out any multi-site adapter/config code and leave only ChatGPT support
- Clean up selectors, injection logic, and any branching that references Claude, Gemini, or Copilot

### Step 8b: Right-Side Popup Placement
- Support placing the popup on the right side of the highlight (not only left)
- Automatically choose whichever side has more room; allow the user to toggle if needed

### Step 8c: Popup Transition Functions — REMOVED in 1.2.0 (only search used them)
- **Goal:** Provide reusable primitives for navigating between any two popup items, with step-by-step animated transitions. Other code (Cmd+F search, future features) composes these instead of building ad-hoc open/close logic.
- **Storage model (quoteId):** Each version of a highlight is an independent storage record `{id, quoteId, text, question, responseHTML, parentId, parentItemId, active, ...}`. Records sharing the same `quoteId` are versions of the same highlight. `parentId` references the parent's `quoteId`. `parentItemId` tracks which specific parent version the child was created in, so `restoreChainedHighlights` only restores children belonging to the active version.
- **Reusable functions:**
  - `JR.openHighlight(quoteId, itemIndex)` — opens any highlight (L1 or nested) by building the full parent chain, scrolling the page, and opening popups one by one. Handles version selection.
  - `JR.transitionTo(targetItemId)` — animated step-by-step transition from the current popup state to any target item:
    - **Same quoteId (version flip):** Steps through intermediate versions one at a time (350ms per step) using the version nav's `switchVersion`, then scrolls to center.
    - **Different quoteId:** Builds ancestor chains for current and target, finds the closest common parent, peels back popups to that parent one by one, then opens popups down to the target one by one. Each step animated at 350ms.
    - **Null target:** Closes all popups and stays in place.
    - **Already on target:** Scrolls to center the popup (handles the "scrolled away" case).
  - `peelOne()` — closes one popup layer (pops the stack), returns the newly active quoteId.
  - `openChildLayer(childQuoteId)` — scrolls the parent's response to a child highlight and opens it as a stacked popup.
  - `flipVersions(quoteId, entry, from, to, delay, callback)` — steps through versions ±1 at a time with delay, calls callback when done.
  - `findItemById(itemId)` — searches all in-memory entries for an item id, returns `{quoteId, entry, itemIndex}`.
  - `getCurrentItemId()` — returns the item id currently displayed in the active popup.
- **Console API (for testing):**
  - `JR.go()` — prints all available items with ids, question snippets, active/current markers, indented by nesting depth.
  - `JR.go("item-id")` — calls `JR.transitionTo` with that item id.
  - `JR.go(null)` — closes all popups.
  - Bridge script (`src/console-bridge.js`) runs in MAIN world via manifest `"world": "MAIN"`, exposing `JR.go()` and `JR.open()` to the browser console. Communicates with the content script via CustomEvents on `document`.
- **Popup open logging:** Every `createPopup` call logs the active item id, quoteId, and question to the console for easy debugging.

### Step 8d: Cmd+F Search Through Hidden Content — REMOVED in 1.2.0 (user request: keep popups + nav widget only)
*Previously Step 8c. Renumbered to make room for Step 8c (Popup Transition Functions).*
- **Goal:** User can Cmd+F to find text inside popup responses (which are hidden Q&A turns). Chrome navigates to the match, and the corresponding popup auto-opens showing both question and response.
- **Built from reusable primitives:**
  - `JR.scrollToAndOpenPopup(hlId)` — scrolls page to highlight + opens popup; reused by nav widget, Cmd+F, and any code path
  - `JR.switchPopupVersionSmooth(hlId, targetVersion)` — crossfade version switch (0.12s opacity transition) so it feels like a person clicked the version arrow
  - `JR.scrollPopupToHighlight(popupHlId, popupVersion, targetChildHlId)` — scrolls within a popup's response div to a child highlight and opens it, without moving the outer popup
  - `JR.extractPopupContent(hlId)` — recursively extracts all text from a highlight's popup (all versions, all nesting depths); returns `{ hlId, versions: [{ question, responseText, children }] }`
- **No duplicate matches:** Hidden Q&A turns (`.jr-hidden`) have their DOM content stripped (`JR.stripHiddenTurnContent`) and stashed in a JS Map. A `setInterval` re-strips when React re-renders content into stripped elements. `JR.restoreHiddenTurnContent(el)` re-populates a turn before unhiding.
- **Search containers:** `hidden="until-found"` divs (`.jr-search-popup`) hold popup Q&A text — the only findable copy. CSS sr-only technique makes them invisible even when Chrome removes `hidden`. One container per version per highlight.
- **Container ordering:** Top-to-bottom on page (L1 order) → outer-to-inner (depth-first children) → first version to later versions. This ensures Cmd+F/Cmd+G cycles in natural reading order.
- **Auto-open popups:** A `MutationObserver` detects when Chrome reveals a container (removes `hidden` attr) and calls `openHighlightForSearch` which composes the primitives above: opens the L1 popup, walks the parent chain for nested matches, switches version, and centers the popup.
- **Scroll behavior:** Page scrolls so the popup is vertically centered in the viewport. For nested matches, the parent popup's response scrolls to the child highlight. Chrome's auto-scroll is overridden (sync + rAF backup).
- **Inert popups during search:** When a popup is opened by Cmd+F, it gets the `inert` attribute. Chrome's find-in-page (102+) skips inert subtrees entirely, so all matches go through search containers — no double-counting, no count fluctuations, no DOM text manipulation needed during search. `inert` is removed when search ends or popup closes normally.
- **Popup close detection:** `selectionchange` listener detects when Chrome's find moves to a main-page match (selection lands outside popup) → closes the search-opened popup. Cmd+G/F3 keydown listener provides a backup check.
- **Search idle timeout:** A 5-second idle timer auto-clears `searchActive` if no container reveals happen. This handles the case where the user closes the find bar (which fires no page events), ensuring stale search state doesn't persist across find sessions.
- **Container deduplication:** A generation counter (`searchBuildGen`) ensures that when `buildSearchContainers` is called multiple times (e.g., during `restoreHighlights` retry loop), only the last call's async callback creates containers. Stale callbacks bail out.
- **Nav widget:** `JR.navigateHighlight` now calls `JR.scrollToAndOpenPopup` internally — single source of truth for scroll-and-open behavior.

### Step 8e: Nav Widget Should Not Count Unsent Highlights — DONE
- The highlight navigation widget currently increments the count (e.g. shows "1/5") as soon as a new highlight is created for a question that hasn't been sent yet
- The nav widget should only count completed highlights — an unsent/in-progress highlight should not appear in the count or be navigable
- Fix: filter out highlights that don't have a completed response when building the nav list

### Step 8f: Delete Confirmation Bar Refinements — DONE
- Move the cancel text slightly rightward
- Make the confirm/cancel icons smaller
- Confirmation bar pops/scales when user clicks outside (attention grab without red outline or fog overlay)

### Step 8g: Export Highlights as Notes
- Add an export function where users can export their highlighted questions and responses as structured notes (e.g. markdown or plain text)
- Accessible from the extension popup or a toolbar button
- Not urgent — lower priority than other polish items

### Step 8h: Hide Native "Ask ChatGPT" Button — DONE (removed in 1.2.0)
- Small ✕ injected at the top-left edge of ChatGPT's native "Ask ChatGPT" selection button
- MutationObserver detects when the native button appears and injects the ✕
- Clicking it hides the native "Ask ChatGPT" button for the session; JR popups still work normally
- Future "Ask ChatGPT" buttons are auto-hidden while the flag is active
- Recovers automatically on page reload (session-only, not persisted)
- CSS tooltip on hover: "Hide — recovers on reload"

### Step 8i: Logo & Description for Public Release
- Design/decorate the extension logo for the Chrome Web Store
- Write a polished store description and screenshots for public listing

## Step 9: ChatGPT 2026-10 Redesign Migration — DONE (1.2.0-dev, not yet released)
- ChatGPT's redesign broke every DOM hook; Popup silently did nothing. Full diagnosis and plan: `collab/PLAN.md`; current state and next steps: **`collab/HANDOFF.md`**.
- 9a DOM migration: all ChatGPT selectors in `src/site-adapter.js`; turn identity = `data-turn-key` UUID; self-check `JR.diagnose()` (for testing; no banner shown to users since 1.2.1); send failures say which step failed — DONE
- 9b Keys-only storage (`popup:conv:<id>`), content read back from ChatGPT (DOM / session cache / conversation data), removed per-frame page-wide observers — DONE
- 9c Network-stream capture for answers whose turn is never mounted (`src/net-tap.js`), scroll guard (`src/scroll-guard.js`), word-by-word streaming — DONE
- 9e Removed the search bar + transition API; ponytail simplicity pass (~1,900 lines deleted) — DONE
- 9f Scroll smoothness with many hidden Q&As — DONE: per-mount work sliced into idle time (reapply ≤ ~35 ms per slice, mount pass ~1 ms); gaps removed at the root by filtering Popup turns out of the page's conversation data and fixing the parent of the user's next message (`src/net-tap.js`, DEBUG #52). Live-session Popup Q&As keep a 13 px CSS-hidden row until the next reload.
- 9g Removed the × on ChatGPT's native "Ask ChatGPT" button (user request) — DONE
- 9h ponytail-audit fixes, version memory, dark-mode ice blue, hover/open highlight shades — DONE (DEBUG #51–#53)
- 9i Formulas: exact TeX in questions, rendered formulas in quotes, partial-formula highlights, \\boxed selection — DONE (DEBUG #54)
- 9d Release: version 1.2.0, store zip built (`dist/Popup-1.2.0.zip`, not in git) — upload to the Chrome Web Store is the user's step
